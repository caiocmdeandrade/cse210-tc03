# Hello! My name is Celeste Popoca. I am a Computer Engineering
#  major. I enjoy playing aquatic sports and painting in
#  watercolor. I love learning new things from people. I think
#  everyone has something special to share to better the lives
#  of the people around them.

My name is Claudio Ezequiel Iannone, but I'm mainly known as 'Echi,' my nickname. 
I'm 34 years old, married, and the father of a five years old boy. 
I live in a small city called Balcarce, in the Buenos Aires province, in Argentina. 
I don't have a favorite food, but I enjoy pasta, pizzas, and ice cream (anytime). 
I like to watch movies and tv series (currently watching 'The Flash'). Also, I like music, listening to and singing. 
I've participated in choirs and wrote some small arrangements for hymns in my ward. 
I'm not a good reader, except by the church books and magazines, blogs, or web pages with information related to technology, 
courses, or anything I could use to work. From CSE 210, I hope to learn as much as possible to improve my skills to work someday as a programmer.
